Coding Standards
================

Please try and stick to the GNU coding standards.  A lot of hard work
went into making Check compatible with the standards, and would be
nice if that work didn't erode.  I decided on the standards because
they work well for a lot of programs much bigger than Check.  Ok,
since you're wondering, the advantages of sticking to the standards
are three-fold:

  1) consistent style within the project

  2) being familiar with the standards lets you work on lots of
     different GNU standards-compliant projects pretty easily

  3) it reduces the number of decisions that must be made

So far, the only intentional deviation from the standards is the use
of `svn log -v > SVNChangeLog' to generate an SVNChangeLog, rather
than manual editing.  Subversion solves many of the problems in CVS,
for which the GNU ChangeLog rules are written, the lack of atomic
commits being one of them.  However, this doesn't work for make
distcheck because it never reaches the SVN working copy, so perhaps a
better mechanism is needed.

Release Process
===============

Start by making sure everything is OK.

1.  svn co https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/check
2.  cd check/trunk (or tagged version)
3.  autoreconf --install
4.  ./configure
5.  make check
6.  ulimit -c 0
7.  make distcheck
8.  make -C doc check.html

When the above works:

1.  Decide on revision suitable for release.
2.  svn cp -rXXX https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/check/trunk https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/check/tags/check-X.Y.Z
3.  cd ~/check
4.  svn up
5.  cd check-X.Y.Z
6.  Update NEWS with info from `svn log | less`.
7.  Update TODO and make sure version numbers match appropriately.
8.  Update configure.ac with new version numbers.
9.  svn ci
10.  autoreconf --install
11. ./configure
12. ulimit -c 0
13. make check
14. make distcheck
15. make -C doc check.html
16. rsync -av . USERNAME@shell.sourceforge.net:/home/groups/c/ch/check/htdocs
17. sftp USERNAME@frs.sourceforge.net
> cd uploads
> put check-X.Y.Z.tar.gz
> exit
18. Locally copy NEWS to NEWS-release, cut out old release news.
19. Copy SVNChangeLog to SVNChangeLog-release, cut out old release log.
20. Go to: http://sourceforge.net/project/admin/newrelease.php?package_id=20116&group_id=28255
21. Enter X.Y.Z as new release name, hit "Create this release"
22. Upload NEWS-release, SVNChangeLog-release
23. Tick "Preserve my pre-formatted text", hit "Submit/Refresh"
24. Tick "check-X.Y.Z.tar.gz" in list, hit "Add Files and/or Refresh View"
25. Choose "Platform-Independent" for Processor
26. Choose "Source .gz" for File Type
27. Hit "Update/Refresh"
28. In a new tab or window go to: http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=28255
29. Check project notes, verify NEWS-release and SVNChangeLog-release uploads look OK.
30. Back in the old tab, tick "I'm sure" and hit "Send Notice".
31. Send the following email to check-devel at lists dot sourceforge dot net:
Subject: check-X.Y.Z released
Hi,

<some sentence about the release, e.g. "This is a bug fix release."> 
Please test it out and report any problems you might have!

32. Send the same message to check-announce and check-users
33. cd ~/check/trunk
34. svn up
35. svn merge -r(rev. in step #4):(rev. in step #9) ../tags/check-X.Y.Z .
