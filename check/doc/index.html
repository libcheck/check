    <H1>Check: A unit test framework for C</H1>
    
    <P>Check is a unit test framework for C. It features a simple
    interface for defining unit tests, putting little in the way of
    the developer. Tests are run in a separate address space, so Check
    can catch both assertion failures and code errors that cause
    segmentation faults or other signals. The output from unit tests
    can be used within source code editors and IDEs..</P>
    
    <P>Check was inspired by similar frameworks that currently exist
    for most programming languages; the most famous example being
    JUnit for Java (<A HREF="www.junit.com">www.junit.com</A>). There
    is a list of unit test frameworks for multiple languages at <A
    HREF="http://www.xprogramming.com/software.htm">www.xprogramming.com/software.htm</A>
    . Unit testing has a long history as part of formal quality
    assurance methodologies, but has recently been associated with the
    lightweight methodology called Extreme Programming. In that
    methodology, the characteristic practice involves interspersing
    unit test writing with coding (" test a little, code a
    little"). While the incremental unit test/code approach is
    indispensable to Extreme Programming, it is also applicable, and
    perhaps indispensable, outside of that methodology.

    <P>The incremental test/code approach provides three main benefits
    to the developer:<P>
      
    <OL>
      <LI>Because the unit tests use the interface to the unit being
      tested, they allow the developer to think about how the
      interface should be designed for usage early in the coding
      process.</LI>
      
      <LI>They help the developer think early about aberrant cases,
      and code accordingly.</LI>

      <LI>By providing a documented level of correctness, they allow
      the developer to refactor (see <A
      HREF="http://www.refactoring.com">www.refactoring.com</A> )
      aggressively.</LI>
      
    </OL>
    
    <P>That third reason is the one that turns people into unit
    testing addicts. There is nothing so satisfying as doing a
    wholesale replacement of an implementation, and having the unit
    tests reassure you at each step of that change that all is
    well. It is like the difference between exploring the wilderness
    with and without a good map and compass: without the proper gear,
    you are more likely to proceed cautiously and stick to the marked
    trails; with it, you can take the most direct path to where you
    want to go.<P>

    <h3>TODO</h3>

    The following enhancements are being considered for Check:

    <ul>
      <li>Printing and Logging
	<ul>
	  <li>Allow unit test output (stdout and stderr) to be
	  captured and logged</li>

	  <li>Create an XML DTD for test
	  output</li>

	  <li>Enhance the current TestResult interface & structures to
	  match the DTD/model</li>

	  <li>Open the API for printing/logging customization</li>

	  <li>JUnit-style UI?</li>
	</ul>
      </li>
      <li>Unit test writing
	<ul>
	  <li>Allow unit tests that expect signals or exits</li>
	  
	  <li>Allow unit tests that expect output (see stdout logging
	  above) (but maybe perl/sh/expect/dejagnu are better
	  tools)</li>

	  <li>Interface with gcov somehow???</li>

	  <li>Autoproduce unit test framework from header files</li>
	  
	</ul>
      </li>
      <li>Check tests
	<ul>
	  <li>Use gcov to test and expand coverage of existing unit
	  tests</li>

	  <li>Increase tests for more non-public modules</li>

	  <li>Refactor to allow better unit testing of printing
	  functionality (without end-to-end testing of output</li>
	</ul>
      </li>
      <li>Packaging
	<ul>
	  <li>Automate RPM production</li>

	  <li>Debian packaging</li>

	  <li>Get Check into Debian Sid</li>
	</ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
	
    
    <h3>CVS access</h3>
    <P>To contribute to Check, you should download the source through
    anonymous CVS, following these simple instructions:</P>
    
    <OL>
      <LI>Navigate to the directory below which you want the new check
      directory to be formed. That is, if you navigate to
      /home/luser/foo/bar, the check files will be in
      /home/luser/foo/bar/check.</LI>

      <LI>Issue the following command to login to CVS. When prompted
      to supply the anonymous password, simply hit return.
	<HR>
<PRE>
$ cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.check.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/check login
</PRE>
	<HR>
      </LI>
      <LI>Issue the following command to setup the check subdirectory
	<HR>
<PRE>
$ cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.check.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/check co check
</PRE>
	<HR>
      </LI>

      <LI>To keep current with CVS, use the following command within the
check directory
	<HR>
<PRE>
$ cvs -z3 update -dP 
</PRE>
	<HR>
 
	<P>Note that you do not have to supply the server directory
	path or the user name (it is all kept in the CVS local
	directory.)
      </LI>
    </OL>
    
    <P>From that point on, using Check should simply be a matter of
      the standard:
    <P>
    <HR>
    <PRE>
$ ./configure
$ make
$ make install
</PRE>
    <HR>
    <P>Of course, since Check comes with its own unit tests, you can (and should)
    substitute "make check" for "make" in the above.</P>
