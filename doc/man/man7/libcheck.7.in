\(em unit testing framework for C
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Check is a unit testing framework for C. It features a
simple interface for defining unit tests, putting little in
the way of the developer. Tests are run in a separate
address space, so Check can catch both assertion failures
and code errors that cause segmentation faults or other
signals. The output from unit tests can be used within
source code editors and IDEs.
